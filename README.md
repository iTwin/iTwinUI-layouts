## Key features

While the iTwinUI-React package makes it easy to place singular components, that’s only half of the struggle when trying to deliver a beautiful, consistent, and accessible web interface.  
iTwinUI-Layouts takes those components and places them accordingly within the page with minimal effort on the development side.
